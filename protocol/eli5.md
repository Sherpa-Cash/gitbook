Transactions in a blockchain ultimately form one long chain, which makes it easy to trace. Sherpa Cash improves transaction privacy by breaking the on-chain link between the recipient and destination addresses.

It uses a smart contract that accepts AVAX deposits that can be withdrawn by a different address. Whenever AVAX is withdrawn by the new address, there is no way to link the withdrawal to the deposit, ensuring complete privacy.
