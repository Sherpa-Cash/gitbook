# Welcome to Sherpa Cash

### What is Sherpa Cash?

Sherpa Cash is a fork of Tornado Cash, a fully decentralized protocol for private transactions based on zkSNARKS, but for the Avalanche network.

### Why the name Sherpa Cash?

Sherpas regularly deal with unexpected weather, predators, obscured paths, and many other obstacles. A great Sherpa makes quick adjustments to prevent any major setback. This ability to assess, react, and adapt is critical to great leadership and teamwork. As active contributors to the Avalanche community,  we're here to be your Sherpas: trusted and helpful people you can rely on.

### The goal of Sherpa Cash

Avalanche is still in its early days and no privacy protocol currently exists for it. We don't claim to be cryptography experts, nor are we here to reinvent the wheel. And since Tornado Cash has become the gold standard for privacy, our solution is to implement it in its entirety \(with relayers and anonymity mining and all\) and oversee any upgrades that will be needed in the future so Avalanche users can have a trusted privacy protocol that they can rely on. 

Initially, Sherpa Cash will be governed by the founding team, but ultimately control of the project will be transferred to the community, where day-to-day operations, business strategy and token utility will be governed by community vote.
