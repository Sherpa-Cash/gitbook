# Welcome to Sherpa Cash

Sherpa Cash is a fork of Tornado Cash, a fully decentralized protocol for private transactions based on zkSNARKS, but for the Avalanche network.

Transactions in a blockchain ultimately form one long chain, which makes it easy to trace. Sherpa Cash improves transaction privacy by breaking the on-chain link between the recipient and destination addresses.

It uses a smart contract that accepts AVAX deposits that can be withdrawn by a different address. Whenever AVAX is withdrawn by the new address, there is no way to link the withdrawal to the deposit, ensuring complete privacy.

Initially, Sherpa Cash will be governed by the founding team, but ultimately control, of the project will be transferred to the community, where day-to-day operations, business strategy and token utility will be governed by community vote.
