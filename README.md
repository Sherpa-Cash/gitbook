# Welcome to Sherpa Cash

Sherpa Cash is a fork of Tornado Cash, a fully decentralized protocol for private transactions based on zkSNARKS, but for the Avalanche network.

Initially, Sherpa Cash will be governed by the founding team, but ultimately control, of the project will be transferred to the community, where day-to-day operations, business strategy and token utility will be governed by community vote.
