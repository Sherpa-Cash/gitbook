# Welcome to Sherpa Cash

Sherpa Cash is a fork of Tornado Cash, a fully decentralized protocol for private transactions based on zkSNARKS, but for the Avalanche network.

Initially, Sherpa Cash will be governed by the founding team, but ultimately control, of the project will be transferred to the community, where day-to-day operations, business strategy and token utility will be governed by community vote.



What makes a good Sherpa? Sherpas regularly deal with unexpected weather, predators, obscured paths, and many other obstacles. A great Sherpa makes quick adjustments to prevent any major setback. This ability to assess, react, and adapt is critical to great leadership. Walk together as a team.
