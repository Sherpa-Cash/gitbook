# Anonymity Mining

Anonymity Mining is a program to incentivize deposits into Sherpa Cash.

Deposits help to secure the privacy of Sherpa Cash. Thus, it should be noted that the Sherpa Cash network can ensure maximum anonymity and privacy when there is a large amount of deposits in its protocol. In that regard, users that deposit AVAX into the network will be rewarded with SHERPA tokens.

More details to follow on how users can participate in Anonymity Mining.
