# ICO

Sherpa Cash will be coordinating with [**Avalaunch**](https://avalaunch.app/)\(a launchpad powered by the Avalanche platform\) for its initial token sale. Details to follow.

### **Whitelist**

On May 14, we announced a content contest on our Twitter page for 10 white-listed spots for SHERPA token's ICO. [**Link**](https://twitter.com/sherpa_cash/status/1393287134287601664)
To qualify for being selected for a white-list spot, you need to produce the best content that describes Sherpa Cash's mission and how Sherpa Cash can contribute Avalanche ecosystem (YouTube video, Medium post, Twitter Flood, How-to article, etc.)

Important note: Five spots will be chosen for content in English. And the other five spots will be chosen for content in your native language since we want to promote an international Sherpa Cash community.

To participate, create content about Sherpa Cash and share the URL under [**this Twitter post**]((https://twitter.com/sherpa_cash/status/1393287134287601664)) with the tag: "Submission for $SHERPA ICO".

The deadline for content submission is May 31st – 12 a.m. \(GMT\).

#### **Evaluation**

Evaluation of the content will be fairly and openly evaluated by a jury of people known and trusted by the Avalanche community.
