# Audit

To be explicitly clear, Sherpa Cash is a fork of Tornado Cash. Other than modifying variable names and contract addresses, no other code has been modified at all. Users are happy to compare the code side by side.

Given this, Sherpa Cash has not been audited, but Tornado Cash has by a group of experts from [ABDK Consulting](https://www.abdk.consulting/), specializing in zero-knowledge, cryptography, and smart contracts.

During the audit, no critical issues were found and all outstanding issues were fixed. The results can be found here:

* Cryptographic review [https://tornado.cash/audits/TornadoCash\_cryptographic\_review\_ABDK.pdf](https://tornado.cash/audits/TornadoCash_cryptographic_review_ABDK.pdf)
* Smart contract audit [https://tornado.cash/audits/TornadoCash\_contract\_audit\_ABDK.pdf](https://tornado.cash/audits/TornadoCash_contract_audit_ABDK.pdf)
* Zk-SNARK circuits audit [https://tornado.cash/audits/TornadoCash\_circuit\_audit\_ABDK.pdf](https://tornado.cash/audits/TornadoCash_circuit_audit_ABDK.pdf)

Underlying circomlib dependency is currently being audited, and the team already published most of the fixes for found issues
