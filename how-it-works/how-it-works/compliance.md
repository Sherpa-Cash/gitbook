description: How compliance works in Sherpa Cash

# Compliance

Maintaining financial privacy is essential to preserving our financial freedom. Compliance is important for many reasons too, so Sherpa Cash has provided a compliance tool.

If it ever becomes necessary to show the origin of your assets you can provide cryptographically verified proof of transactional history using the Sherpa.cash Note.

At the time of deposit, Sherpa.cash generates a private Note that is used later to withdraw funds and can also be used to show their origin.
