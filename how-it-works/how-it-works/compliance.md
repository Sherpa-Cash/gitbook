description: How compliance works in Sherpa Cash

# Compliance

Maintaining financial privacy is essential to preserving our financial freedom. Compliance is important for many reasons too, so Sherpa Cash has provided a compliance tool.

## Compliance Tool

Our compliance tool provides a way for users to ensure that compliance can be met for legal, regulatory, or tax purposes. Here's how: At the time of any deposit, Sherpa.cash generates a private Note that is used later to withdraw funds and can also be used to show their origin.

So if it ever becomes necessary to show the origin of your assets, you can provide cryptographically verified proof of transactional history using the Sherpa.cash Note.
