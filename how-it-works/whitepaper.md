# Whitepaper

Sherpa Cash contracts are forked from Tornado Cash.  
  
Since Tornado Cash has become the gold standard for privacy, our solution is to implement Tornado's contracts in their entirety and oversee any upgrades that will be needed in the future. By using a trusted, tested, and audited protocol, Avalanche users can feel safe using Sherpa Cash.
